JavaFiddle - simple web-based Java IDE.

Following functionality is supposed to be added:

Structural functions:
a) Actions with projects:	
  - Create new project
    * Specify name of project
    * Ability to generate project from existing templates
    * Specify whether to use VCS in project
  - Rename project
  - Delete project (provide warning)
  - Join project (for team work - token-based, if possible)
b) Actions with packages:
  - Create new package (leave possibility of default packaging)
  - Create new folder
  - Rename folder (with offer to update all packages inside java-files)
  - Show folders (expanded view or shortened)
c) Actions with files
  - Create new file
    * Specify file name
    * Specify file type (class, interface, abstract class, etc.)
    * Specify whether to add the file to VCS (if one is present)
d) Download project code in zip-file
e) Add libraries to the project (security issues!)


Editor functions:
- Syntax highlighting.
- Code autocompletion (methods and fields for particular object, packages' import, Ctrl+Click functionality)
- Code style support
- Several tabs of code

Authentication functions:
- Basic user's authentication on user/password (manual user registration, automatic user registration with email-based confirmation)
- Messages from reviewboard/administration/etc.
- User groups management (with rights).

Code compilation and running:
- Compile project
- Run project
- Set limits on execution time, compilation time, RAM amount, access rights (ideal case - run executable in separate virtual machine)

VCS functionality (git-based)
- initiation on project creation
- branching (specify name, choose branch for current work)
- commit, revert, merge with trunk
- show commits history (visual image)
- pull/push functionality (git server must be specified)

Reviewboard functionality
- select fork for review
- prepare review:
  * select files
  * select usergroup
  * select reviewers
- show diff
- add/edit/read comments
- approve/reject

[Ruzhanskaya Anastasiya]Ideas:
Add minimalisti—Å design
If working in with SQL:syntax highlighting, automatic tabs
Actions with packages:delete package,delete folder
Undo operations

[Fedor Erin] Ideas:
- Add code completion for constructors, getters/setters and overrides
- Add step-by-step debug mode
- Maybe it matters to add embedded help about standart oracle classes (e.g. String's methods)

Also integration with Skill Bench and Skill Catalyst projects is expected to be added.
